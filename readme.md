Get a full fake REST API with JSON server as backend

Created for front-end developers who need a quick back-end for prototyping, testing and  mocking.

`json-server`,it allows you to mock the API, and provide dynamic access to data. By dynamic, I mean that we can read, add, update, and delete data `(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)`.

## Getting started

Install JSON Server 

```
npm install -g json-server
```

Create a `db.json` file with some data

```json
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "json", "data": "typicode" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "comment", "postData": 1 }
  ],
  "profile": { "name": "data" }
}
```

Start JSON Server

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

Now if you go to [http://localhost:3000/posts/1](http://localhost:3000/posts/1), you'll get

```json
{ "id": 1, "title": "json", "data": "typicode" }
```

Also when doing requests, it's good to know that:

- If you make POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests, changes will be automatically and safely saved to `db.json` using [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb).
- Your request body JSON should be object enclosed, just like the GET output. (for example `{"name": "Foobar"}`)
- Id values are not mutable. Any `id` value in the body of your PUT or PATCH request will be ignored. Only a value set in a POST request will be respected, but only if not already taken.
- A POST, PUT or PATCH request should include a `Content-Type: application/json` header to use the JSON in the request body. Otherwise it will return a 2XX status code, but without changes being made to the data.
